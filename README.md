# [awaitable_tasks](https://github.com/wangjieest/coroutine_tasks)
awaitable tasks base on resumable functions, with make_task, then, when_all, when_n, when_any.
specially, with an almost zero-cost life time control.
supporting both then-able and await-able, which make encapsulation as easy as it is.
